# Exploratory_Data_Analysis_Project 1 


### Project 1 : 2015/03/08

This repository containt the 4 scripts to make PNG files with household_power_consumption.txt

you can run this scirpt using in a R session this command : 
- source("plot1.R") 
- source("plot2.R") 
- source("plot3.R") 
- source("plot4.R") 

The original data used can be found there :
* <a href="https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip">household_power_consumption</a>
and came from :
* <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Individual+household+electric+power+consumption">household_power_consumption</a>

The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from the UCI web site:
    Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
    Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
    Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
    Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
    Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
    Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
    Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
    Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
    Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
